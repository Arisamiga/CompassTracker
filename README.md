This is one of my first projects with Java! Any feedback would be very appreciated :D

# Installation

First install the .java file.

Then move that file to the `/plugins` folder inside your server!

If you see a message like `Successfully loaded CompassTracker!!` on the console that means you installed it correctly!! 

# How to use

Use `/hider (username)` to add a person for the compass to follow

Use `/finder (username)` to add the person that has the compass

To reset the pairs do `/reload` to reload the plugin.
